# Ajax-request
A simple form validation + request to server via AJAX using jQuery

- Your name has to be up to 30 symbols long containing 3 words and the end of the last one must be min 2 digits.
After you enter your name, 2 last digits out of the name with 4 digits out of the radio-buttons will make a string. Then, by "extracting the digital root" 1 number will be sent to the server in the request, which will be the number of the photo in the response. <br>
Also, according to the entered date, the answer will be how many days you have lived and how many months until the next birthday.
